# autonomous-chess-playing-robotic-arm
uses computer vision to detect the chess board and chess moves , then stockfish is used to generate the next best move an this move physically implemented by the robotic arm

This project uses a droidcam to record the chess board

Stockfish software is used for the move generation

for the hardware part it uses an arduino uno,servo motore(mg996r),3D printed arms,stepper motor
